ascr
====

A simple screenshot uploader to upload screenshots instantly to a remote
webserver. Written because it shouldn't be more convenient to upload to imgur than
a remote SSH host.

Usage
-----

``ascr``: the main executable. Just run on its own it will use import to
take a screenshot and upload it with the date/time as the filename.

If you have xclip installed, it will print the URL on screen and copy it to
your clipboard. Otherwise, it will just print it to the screen.

``ascr filename`` or ``ascr filename.png``: give the screenshot a specific
filename.

Alternatively, to upload to Imgur, just run ``ascr -i``. The URL will be copied
to your clipboard and displayed just like it is for an SSH uploaded image.

Configuration
-------------

``ascr`` uses a ``.ascrrc`` file located in your home directory for
configuration. An example file with the three mandatory options has been
provided:

    SERVER=tschuy@ash.osuosl.org
    DIRECTORY=~/public_html/screenshots/
    URL=https://ash.osuosl.org/~tschuy/screenshots
